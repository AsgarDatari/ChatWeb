# ChatWeb
 
A ChatWeb is a Responsive web application used for global communication with people.

Deployed on Vercel: chatweb-awful.vercel.app

<h3> You can sign up or sign in with any email, as this is just a project. We don't save or share your password because we store everything in Firebase, and we use Firebase's inbuilt functions for signing in, signing up, and signing out. </h3>

The project reached its running state due to the hard work of three individuals:

   * Asgar Datari [Frontend Designer & Team Leader]
   * Aaquif Qureshi [Backend Engineer & Database Engineer]
   * Mrunal Shah [Backend Architect & Mentor]
